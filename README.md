REQUIREMENTS:

1] Application : Visual studio and Browser 2] A computer with a processor that is fast enough to encode and decode the hidden message. 3] Operating System : Windows, mac, Linux

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE TEXT, IMAGE AND AUDIO STEGANOGRAPHY:

STEP 1: First, keep the all source code in same folder STEP 2: Install Visual Studio to run the python files. STEP 3: In Visual Studio, select File -> Open Folder which contains the python files. STEP 4: After opening the files,check whether the required libraries are installed in the system or not. STEP 5: If not go to visual studio terminal or command prompt to install the required python libraries. STEP 6: In app.py,click Run -> Run without debugging to execute the program. STEP 7: It will take you to the browser window to run the project text, image, and audio steganography.

WORKING:

Text Steganography

1] Open the text file that you want to hide the message in. 2] Create the message that you want to hide. 3] Use a steganography tool to encode the message into the text file. 4] Save the text file. 5] upload the text file to the decode. 6] The decode uses a steganography tool to extract the message from the text file.

Image Steganography

1] Open the image file that you want to hide the message in. 2] Create the message that you want to hide. 3] Use a steganography tool to encode the message into the image file. 4] Save the image file. 5] upload the image file to the decode. 6] The decode uses a steganography tool to extract the message from the image file.

Audio Steganography

1] Open the audio file that you want to hide the message in. 2] Create the message that you want to hide. 3] Use a steganography tool to embed the message into the audio file. 4] Save the audio file. 5] upload the audio file to the decode. 6] The decode uses a steganography tool to extract the message from the audio file.
